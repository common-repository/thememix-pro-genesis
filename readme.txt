Genesis Pro by ThemeMix adds the following page templates:

There are numerous plugins out there that help Genesis play nice with plugins that featured rich custom post types. Most, if not all, of these plugins area quite old or still depend on old configuration. We've gone ahead and rewritten current solution to a more modern approach of what we think Genesis Compatibility should looks like. No bloat, only loading what is necessary to make Genesis play nice.

* BuddyPress
* bbPress
* WooCommerce
* Easy Digital Downloads

We've added an up to date Genesis Featured Content widget that is based on the various solutions out there, but made more modern. We've also, as a bonus, made it compatible with displaying featured BuddyPress Groups.
